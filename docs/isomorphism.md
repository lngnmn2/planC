This is the most deep and subtle subject. It uncovers something *truly universal*.

The abstract &ldquo;duality&rdquo; is bullshit, while the Gerhard Gentzen&rsquo;s principle that *the logical terms come in pairs &#x2013; an &ldquo;introduction&rdquo; and a corresponding &ldquo;elimination&rdquo;* is a big deal, really.

In programming this would corresponds to the similar *naturally emerging* &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; among *Algebraic Data Types*. There is (or at least must be) *always* a &ldquo;construction&rdquo; &#x2013; calling of a &ldquo;constructor&rdquo; (an &ldquo;introduction&rdquo;) and &ldquo;the use site&rdquo; (an &ldquo;elimination&rdquo;), be it via pattern matching, calling selectors, or calling a function.

This, of course, goes way deeper. Any properly captured concept of a human mind has to have its &ldquo;use site&rdquo; (elimination). This is subtle.

In the *evolved* molecular biology, however, everything is more straightforward &#x2013; everything produced with expenditure of energy (by an enzyme) has its &ldquo;use&rdquo;. An enzyme itself took millions of years to evolve to be &ldquo;just right&rdquo; to properly catalyze a biochemical reaction, which otherwise would not occur (requires more energy).

Again, there is something *universal* has been *partially* captured here, unlike abstract category theoretic bullshit about abstract duals. Biology &ldquo;constructs&rdquo; to be &ldquo;used&rdquo;. Minds of external observers *capture and generalize*, and thus partially capture some of the universal principles.

The Curry-Howard Isomorphism captures the notion that &ldquo;we are watching the same mountain from different angles&rdquo;, while the &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; is the *emergent* processes *constrained* by the &ldquo;physical laws&rdquo; and emerging from them *causality*. And, of course, *everything* in the Universe is a *process* (and has a &ldquo;graph&rdquo; which caused it).

Okay, it is not a random coincidence that just `3` of Algebraic Data Types are enough for everything. The *universal notions* which we call `AND`, `OR` and `Step` (`,` a *&ldquo;product type&rdquo;* `|`, a *&ldquo;sum type&rdquo;*, `->`, an *&ldquo;arrow type&rdquo;* or a &ldquo;step&rdquo;) are the most fundamental and truly Universal.

Yes, there are *subtleties*, like *&ldquo;AND THEN&rdquo;* and *&ldquo;AND ALSO&rdquo;*, which is not a *meaningfully* dual to &ldquo;OR ELSE&rdquo;. &ldquo;Forks&rdquo; (&ldquo;ORs&rdquo;) are always *potential* (only one &ldquo;step&rdquo; will be taken), while &ldquo;joins&rdquo; (ANDs) are always *actual structures or being actually present in a particular locality (at an appropriate distance)*.

One more time: the product-types, the sum-types and the function-types are enough to properly capture and *represent* literally everything. There are corresponding patterns in the classic algorithm charting techniques, which are enough for drawing *any* algorithm (the proper *short-circuiting* branching, which corresponds to *never* taking both steps, requires *a lazy evaluation*, while looping is just a *spiral of recursion* &#x2013; yes, yes, it is all that fundamental and complementary interrelated).

At a higher level, there are &ldquo;partitions&rdquo; &#x2013; *abstract interfaces*, which are named sets of these algebraic types.

*Type-level parameterization*, *Type-Classes (with application type-constructors)* or *Traits*, which, by the way, give rise to particular *capabilities*, can also be traced back to system biology and to *What Is*.

And for each &ldquo;introduction&rdquo; (definition) there has to be an &ldquo;elimination&rdquo; (a use-site) with structural patterns-matching (as in molecular biology) or a transformation by an *enzyme*.

All the biological &ldquo;pathways&rdquo; are just &ldquo;nested&rdquo; (chained) procedures. Everything is *data* &#x2013; actual molecular structures (there is no hidden state, a &ldquo;counter&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;number&rdquo;) and everything happens as in logical in the Modus Ponens &#x2013; once all the *necessary and sufficient* conditions meet (an enzyme is fully &ldquo;filled&rdquo;) the transformation (the reaction) occur.

And the &ldquo;runtime&rdquo; is the particular locality (with its particular set of constraints) of the whole universe (a localized sub-process), of course.

The old-school classic mostly-functional languages (both the LISP and the ML families) were *intuitively* onto something. And yes, any non-bullshit mathematics just properly captures, generalizes and abstracts away some fundamental aspects of *What Is*.

So, the *&ldquo;design for the use-site&rdquo;* mantra is universally meaningful.
