Recently I have been watching lots of cooking videos, mostly Chinese and Indian.

I have noticed that the taste of the most Chinese foods would be the same &#x2013; burned oil, over-heated, over-saturated fats and excess of dried red chilliest, which makes a mouth numb. (This is OK, it is how to serve a rotten produce using a wood-burning stoves.)

I didn&rsquo;t realize until much later what is the common principle behind all these videos &#x2013; *they do no understand food* (how excessive heat breaks pieces of *aminoacids*, which we need to ingest into a molecular pulp, how &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; molecules are &ldquo;big&rdquo; and fragile &#x2013; almost as those of a &ldquo;fragrance&rdquo; &#x2013; so they should be added *last*, etc), they never tried to and they *do not want to understand*.

They are even proud of it &#x2013; they follow the memorized and &ldquo;perfected&rdquo; by endless repetitions fixed procedure, never asking any &ldquo;whys&rdquo;, and they consider themselves as real &ldquo;masters&rdquo; (or professionals).

Indian foods are better, because the literal *heaps of different spices* they throw into a pan are actual sundried and grinded seeds, so they are good (even necessary) for a proper digestion.

So, just following a fixed procedure without any understanding. I have seen this before.

There was a famous (at the time) text called

[The Programmer&rsquo;s Stone](https://www.datapacrat.com/Opinion/Reciprocality/r0/index.html)

Back then I was much impressed with it, nowadays I realize that it was a low-effort piece, written in a rush. The wording and metaphors can be way better and more accurate to reflect the actual mental states. &ldquo;Mapping&rdquo; means almost nothing.

The proper metaphors are &ldquo;an army grounds&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;a philosophy (or math) department&rdquo;.

The later *begin with a proper understanding (and cannot proceed without it)*, with the former begin with a fixed procedure (and cannot proceed without it).

Now everything &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;. There are &ldquo;coders&rdquo;, who are proud of themselves for never bothering with understanding and with these crappy theories (yes, most of too abstract theories are an abstract terminology joggling crap, indeed).

They follow &ldquo;better&rdquo; &ldquo;agile&rdquo; procedures and use a lot of &ldquo;tools of the trade&rdquo;, like these memory leak detectors. They are all consider themselves as real masters (or professionals).

It is them, who usually advocate that a *top-down design beforehand*, is an unnecessary waste of time, and that [their] code is the only thing that matters.

There are also &ldquo;programmers&rdquo;. Most of actually good programmers (with notable exception of Carmack) are *math majors*. For them *understanding is what they do for a living*. (There are also idiots &#x2013; a vast majority &#x2013; who treat *math* as a set of fixed procedures).

They know that the code is the last and less important part, and that a proper understanding and decomposition of a problem [domain] into meaningful abstractions (which has be into an one-to-one correspondence to the actual aspects of *What Is*) and to define corresponding clear, non-leaking abstraction barriers, is what programming is about.

One more time &#x2013; the adequacy of a decomposition of the problem domain and proper mapping of the concepts (abstractions) into [Abstract] Algebraic Types and Abstract Interfaces (into modules) is what determines a quality (and success) of a program.

There is no substitute for a proper understanding.

The second crucial part is to choice just right data-structures to represent these *adequately captured* abstractions, and the program &ldquo;almost writes itself&rdquo; (the shape of the data determines the shape of the code &#x2013; notably recursion).

Unsurprisingly, mathematically mature people and analytical minds in general tends to use &ldquo;mostly functional languages&rdquo;, based on *their right understanding*.

This is because mathematics itself is a set of &ldquo;types&rdquo; and corrresponding notations, and that the most of the concepts of abstract algebra and of the set theory are *technically* defined as &ldquo;Abstract Data Types&rdquo;. Yes, just go and check yourself.

Last but not least, it is **this**, that was behind the enormous &ldquo;success&rdquo; of the Bell Labs (and its uniqueness in general). A bunch of *math literate* guys were stationed together in a quiet, friendly environment (separated from idiots) and asked (among other things) to write [telecommunication] software.

These guys *started with a proper understanding*, and then everything just naturally followed.

Nowadays we are downing in a junk-food software, &ldquo;languages&rdquo; and &ldquo;frameworks&rdquo;.

Almost everything in serious programming has been solved by the late 90s. The *type-classes* of Haskell and the *lifetimes* (and *traits*) or Rust are the only major fundamental innovations since then.
